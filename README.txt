Prerequisites

You need a working Android development environment, consisting of the Android SDK and the Android NDK. The easiest way is to use Android Studio to download and install the SDK and NDK. Make sure that the Android/Sdk/tools and Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle directories are on your path.

You also need Oracle's Java JDK (OpenJDK is not compatible with Android). You also need the Apache Ant build system. You also need Git, GNU Make, and a C compiler.

If everything is working, you should be able to run these commands from the command line:

Android SDK tools: android, emulator, and adb.
Android NDK tools: ndk-build.
Oracle Java JDK 8: java, and javac.
Apache Ant: ant.
Git: git.
GNU Make: make, or gmake.
C compiler: cc, gcc, or clang.

1. To compile this project you need Android Studio installed in your machine.
2. Download the project from git.
3. Either directly import project from git in android studio using git link or download the project and imoprt it in studio.
4. clean and build the project.
5. Run as Android application to generate APK file.
